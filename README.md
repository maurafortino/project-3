# What is Book Exchange?

Book Exchange is an application that allows people to get rid of their old textbooks that have little or no monetary value and purchase textbooks without the expensive costs associated with textbooks. Students are able to search our database of books that others are selling by subject in the Subject Tab.
Once the subject has been chosen, all of the textbooks in that subject will appear. Once the user has identified which book they would like to purchase, they can contact the seller via email and determine the best options to exchange the book.
The only cost that the buyer pays is the cost of shipping if the book is too far to travel to recieve it.
All transactions are handle between the buyer and the seller outside of our site. 

Users are also able to sign up or log into their account and view all of the books that they are currently selling on their user page. Book Exchange helps connect people from all over with our site but 
ALL transactions are handled between the buyer and the seller outside of the site. Please remember to follow our safety rules for meeting in public locations, validating shipping reciepts, and using 3rd party applications to send money.

Happy Exchanging!!
